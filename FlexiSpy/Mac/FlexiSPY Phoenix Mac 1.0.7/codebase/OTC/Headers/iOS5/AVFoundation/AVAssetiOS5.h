  @class		AVAsset

  @abstract
	An AVAsset is an abstract class that defines AVFoundation's model for timed audiovisual media.

	Each asset contains a collection of tracks that are intended to be presented or processed together, each of a uniform media type, including but not limited to audio, video, text, closed captions, and subtitles.

  @discussion
	AVAssets are often instantiated via its concrete subclass AVURLAsset with NSURLs that refer to audiovisual media resources, such as streams (including HTTP live streams), QuickTime movie files, MP3 files, and files of other types.

	They can also be instantiated using other concrete subclasses that extend the basic model for audiovisual media in useful ways, as AVComposition does for temporal editing.

	Properties of assets as a whole are defined by AVAsset. Additionally, references to instances of AVAssetTracks representing tracks of the collection can be obtained, so that each of these can be examined independently.
					
	Because of the nature of timed audiovisual media, upon successful initialization of an AVAsset some or all of the values for its keys may not be immediately available. The value of any key can be requested at any time, and AVAsset will always return its value synchronously, although it may have to block the calling thread in order to do so.

	In order to avoid blocking, clients can register their interest in particular keys and to become notified when their values become available. For further details, see AVAsynchronousKeyValueLoading.h.

	On iOS, it is particularly important to avoid blocking.  To preserve responsiveness, a synchronous request that blocks for too long (eg, a property request on an asset on a slow HTTP server) may lead to media services being reset.

	To play an instance of AVAsset, initialize an instance of AVPlayerItem with it, use the AVPlayerItem to set up its presentation state (such as whether only a limited timeRange of the asset should be played, etc.), and provide the AVPlayerItem to an AVPlayer according to whether the items is to be played by itself or together with a collection of other items. Full details available in AVPlayerItem.h and AVPlayer.h.
					
	AVAssets can also be inserted into AVMutableCompositions in order to assemble audiovisual constructs from one or more source assets.
